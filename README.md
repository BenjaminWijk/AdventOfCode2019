# AdventOfCode2019

Just my Advent Of Code solutions for 2019 ( https://adventofcode.com/2019 )

Readability is more important than optimization for me: there are most likely way faster solutions than mine. 
...And most likely way more readable as well. : )

Highly recommend not looking at the follow-up intcode computer tasks (5,7). 
The tasks were a lot lower level than I prefer (you're practically making a simple CPU), so I haven't really cleaned them up all that much.
